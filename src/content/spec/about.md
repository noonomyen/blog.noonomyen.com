## The "Don't Know Everything" Team

I created this team back in 2022. At the time, I had no idea what to name it - so I turned to a personal insecurity: not knowing things that most people seem to understand. I took that weakness and made it our name.

I've been using this name ever since.

Team members who have participated:

- [@c0ffeeOverdose](https://github.com/c0ffeeOverdose)
- [@FoxZFox](https://github.com/FoxZFox)
- [@willywotz](https://github.com/willywotz)

I'm genuinely proud of this team name. While we've already made it to national-level competitions, I hope one day we can break into the top ranks.

Thank you to everyone for the effort and dedication that brought the name **Don't Know Everything** to where it is today.
