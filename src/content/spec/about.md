# About

I'm just a computer science student. I mostly like to do things on a whim, sometimes I don't even know what I truly enjoy.

Currently, my main interests include coding, programming contests, capture the flag, operating systemsm, machine learning, electronic, network and computer architecture. I'm not sure if I'll still feel the same way in the future.
