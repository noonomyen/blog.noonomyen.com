We only collect aggregate visit data using **Cloudflare Web Analytics**, which relies on **Real User Measurements (RUM)** to gather performance metrics such as page load times. This data is fully anonymized and does not include any personally identifiable information.

Cloudflare Web Analytics does not use cookies, localStorage, or fingerprinting techniques based on IP addresses or User Agent strings.

If we implement any additional tracking or analytics tools in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.
